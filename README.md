An one Sentence per Line (OSPL) Mode for Emacs
----------------------------------------------

If you are writing a lot of text (e.g., LaTeX), you know the problem
that a text file that is filled at 80 columns produces awful diffs.
Therefore, it is beneficial to have only one sentence per line. This
package provides this as an Emacs minor mode, where `M-q` fills the
current paragraph to OSPL.
